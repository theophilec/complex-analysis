# Complex analysis - Study guide and materials

This repository is based off of materials by S. Boisg√©rault (Mines ParisTech) for C1223 *Analyse Complexe et Applications* -- aka *Ski Maths* -- for second year graduate students at Mines ParisTech.

The goal is not to replace the textbook but to offer a concise summary for myself (as a TA) and to the students, after they've taken the course.
