\subsection{Quick reminders}

\subsubsection{Open sets}
\begin{defi}[Open set]
    A set $\Omega \subset A$ is open in $A$ when:$ \forall a\in\Omega, \exists r > 0, \forall y \in \mathcal{B}_r(a), y \in \Omega $
\end{defi}

Alternatively:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $ \forall a\in\Omega, \exists r > 0, \forall y \in A, ||y - a|| < r \implies y \in \Omega $
        \item $\mathring \Omega = \Omega$
    \end{itemize}
In practice:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It can be "clear": the goal of this course is not to show that sets are open. 
    \item Write $\Omega$ as the inverse image of an open set by a continuous map. For example, the open unit ball is the inverse image of $]0,1[$ by $x\in E \mapsto ||x||$.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{schema} Visually, this means you can get as close as you want to the complement of the open set $\Omega$ and your neighbors are still in $\Omega$.
\end{schema}

\begin{example}
A few examples of open sets are: $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, $]0,1[$. $[0,1]$ and $[0,1[$ are not open.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{The complex plane \& complex functions}
Definitions and properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Definition: $\lbrace x+iy, x\in\mathbb{R}, y\in\mathbb{R} \rbrace$, $i$ such that $i^2=1$.
    \item Exponential, trigonometric forms: $$\exists R>0, \theta, x+iy = R(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)=R\exp(i\theta) $$
    \item Conjugate: $z=x+iy \mapsto \bar z = x - iy$, $z = Re^{i\theta} \mapsto \bar z = Re^{-i\theta}$
    \item \dots 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exo}
    On the structure of $\mathbb{C}$ as a vector space.

        \item Show that the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ is a complex vector space. 
        \item Give a basis. 
        \item What changes if we consider it to be a real vector space?
    \end{enumerate}

    Give an example of a $\mathbb{C}$-linear function. Give a counter-example (an $\mathbb{R}$-linear function from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{C}$ that is not $\mathbb{C}$-linear.)
\end{exo}


\subsection{Complex-differentiable, derivative and differential}
In this section, $\Omega$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{C}$.

\begin{defi}[Complex-differentiability \& Derivative]
    Let $z$ an interior point in $\Omega$. Then, $f$ is \emph{complex-differentiable} at $z$ iff the \emph{complex derivative} of $f$ exists in $\mathbb{C}$, as defined by 
    $$ f'(z) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0, h\in\mathbb{C}}\frac{f(z+h) - f(z)}{h} $$ 
\end{defi}

\begin{note}
    Let's insist on the $h\in\mathbb{C}$ in the definition. This means that the limit exists no matter the direction from which we are "arriving" in $\mathbb{C}$. Also, no matter the direction, the value is the same.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
    The previous definition is a \emph{local} property. Let's generalize it to $\Omega$ below.
\end{note}

\begin{defi}[Holomorphic]
    $f: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is \emph{holomorphic} if $\forall z\in\Omega$, it is \emph{complex-differentiable}, i.e. \emph{complex-differentiable everywhere.}
\end{defi}
 
\begin{example} Some examples of holomorphic functions. Also, a counter-example.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Some "obvious" examples: constant functions, identity, affine, \dots
        \item ($\star$) Show the inverse function is holomorphic where it is defined. 
        \item ($\star$) A counter example: the complex conjuguate function is nowhere complex-differentiable.
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{defi}
    Let $f: A\subset \mathbb{C} \rightarrow\mathbb{C} $.

    Let $z\in A$ as interior point. 

    We define the \emph{complex-differential} (or $\mathbb{C}$-differential) of $f$ in $z$ a complex-linear, continous operator $df_x: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C} $ that verifies:
        $$ \lim_{h\rightarrow 0, h\in\mathbb{C}}\frac{||f(z+h) - f(z) - df_z(h)||}{||h||} = 0 $$ 
    Equivalently:
        $$ f(z+h) = f(z) + df_z(h) + o(h) $$ 
\end{defi}
\begin{note}
    Recall that $$g(h) = o(h) \iff \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{g(h)}{h} =0 $$
\end{note}
\begin{note}
    This result extends to $f : E \rightarrow F$ where $E$ and $F$ are complex, normed vector spaces. For example, $\mathbb{C}^n$.
\end{note}


Now, an important theorem that reflects the structure of $\mathbb{C}$:
\begin{thm*}
    Let $f: A \subset\mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$. Let $z \in \mathring A$. 
    
    The complex-differential of $f$ $df_z$ exists iff the derivative $f'(z)$ exists.
    
    In this case, we have:
    $$\forall h \in \mathbb{C}, df_z(h) = f'(z)h$$
\end{thm*}

\begin{note}
    This is linked to our view of $\mathbb{C}$ as a complex vector space, of dimension $1$.
\end{note}

\subsection{Complex-differentiability in practice}

\subsubsection{Calculus}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathbb{C}$-linear combination
    \item Product
    \item Chain rule
    \item Quotient
    \item Polynomials
    \item Rational fractions
\end{itemize}

In practice: \emph{calculate like in $\mathbb{R}$}.

These "usual" properties allow us to verify that functions are $\mathbb{C}$-differentiable or holomorphic easily, when they are products and compositions (for example).

\subsubsection{Cauchy-Reimann Equations}

We can rephrase the definitions as:
\begin{thm*}
$f$ is complex differentiable on $\Omega$ if and only if both:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $f$ is real-differentiable on $\Omega$ (i.e. its differential exists, but maybe isn't $\mathbb{C}-linear$)
    \item its real-differential is $\mathbb{C}$-linear.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm*}

But the second condition is not easy to prove without expliciting the differential. The Cauchy-Riemann equations offer an alternative formulation of this condition.

The intuition behind the theorem is to look at what happens to the real and imaginary parts of $f$ when we move the real and imaginary parts of $z$

If we write:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item if $f: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, we have $u: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $v: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that:
$$ \forall z \in \mathbb{C}, f(z) = u(z) + iv(z)$$
Of course, $u$ and $v$ are the real and imaginary parts of $f(z)$.

\item and, notice a similar property about $z$:  $$\forall z \in \mathbb{C}, z = x + iy$$ where $x$ and $y$ are the imaginary parts of $z$.
\end{enumerate}

we can then study the following quantities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$
\item $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$, $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$, $\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}$ and $\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}$
\end{itemize}


\begin{thm*}[Cauchy-Riemann Equations]
$f$ is complex differentiable on $\Omega$ if and only if both:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $f$ is real-differentiable (i.e. its differential exists, but maybe isn't $\mathbb{C}-linear$)
    \item its real-differential is $\mathbb{C}$-linear.
\end{enumerate}

The second condition (2) can be replaced by one of the following properties:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] $ \forall z, df_z(i) = idf_z(1)$
    \item[(b)] $f$ verifies the \textbf{complex Cauchy-Riemann equation}:
        $$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{i}\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$$
    \item[(b)] $f$ verifies the \textbf{scalar Cauchy-Riemann equations}:
        $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = +\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}$$
        $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm*}

\begin{thm*}[Cauchy-Riemann Equations (alternate)]
$f$ is complex differentiable on $\Omega$ if and only if one of the following conditions hold:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] 
        $ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ and $ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ exist, are \textbf{continuous} and verify the \textbf{complex Cauchy-Riemann equation}
        $$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{i}\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$$
    \item[(b)] $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$, $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$, $\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}$ and $\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}$ exist, are \textbf{continous} and verify the \textbf{scalar Cauchy-Riemann equations}
        $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = +\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}$$
        $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm*}

\section{Second sesssion: Line Integrals \& Primitives} 
The goal of this chapter is to derive an equivalent to the fundamental theorem of calculus for functions of a complex variable.

Recall that is $\mathbb{R}$ one generally uses a rectangular approximation along the segment one integrates over. In $\mathbb{C}$, the principle is the same: we'll present how we can build paths on $\mathbb{C}$ and then how we can integrate over them by approximating the paths.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Paths}
\subsubsection{Definition, Vocabulary \& Examples}
\begin{defi}[Path]
    A path is a continuous function from $[0, 1]$ to $\mathbb{C}$.
\end{defi}

\begin{note}
    The intuition behind a path is that it is parametrized by time, or another variable independent of the complex plane.
\end{note}

\begin{exo}[Unit circle]
    Give a path whose image is the unit circle.
\end{exo}

\begin{exo}[Straight line]
    Give a path such that $\gamma(0) = a$ and $\gamma(1) = b$ where $a, b \in \mathbb{C}$. 
\end{exo}

\begin{note}
    Paths are oriented!
\end{note}

\begin{exo}[Reverse path]
    Given a path $\gamma$ how would you describe its reverse path $\gamma^{\leftarrow}$.
\end{exo}


\subsubsection{Image of a path}
\begin{defi}[Image of a path]
    The image (or trajectory, or trace) of a path $\gamma$ is $\gamma([0,1])$, all the points reached by the path.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[Path on a subset]
    A path is \emph{on $A\subset\mathbb{C}$} if its image is a subset of $A$, i.e. $\gamma([0,1])\subset A$.
\end{defi}

\begin{exo}
    The image of a path is compact.
\end{exo}

\begin{proof}[Solution]
    $\gamma$ is continuous and $[0,1]$ is compact (closed and bounded, in a finite dimensional space), so $\gamma([0,1])$ is compact.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Path concatenation}

Here we present the vocabulary and properties necessary to build more complex paths.
\begin{defi}[Consecutive paths]
    Two paths $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ are consecutive if $\gamma_1(1) = \gamma_2(0)$, i.e. if $\gamma_1$ terminates (terminal point) where $\gamma_2$ begins (initial point).
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[Path concatenation]
    Let $t_0=0 < t_1 < \dots < t_{n-1} < 1=t_n $ be a partition of $[0,1]$ (these are our endpoints).

    Let $\gamma_1$, \dots, $\gamma_n$ $n$ consecutive paths (these are the paths.)

    The concatenation of $\gamma_1, \dots, \gamma_n$ associated to the partition $t_0, \dots, t_{n-1}$ is the path $\gamma$ uniquely defined such that:
    \boxed{
    $$ \forall k \in \lbrace0, \dots, n-1\rbrace, \gamma_{|[t_{k-1}, t_{k}]}= \gamma_k\left( \frac{t-t_{k-1}}{t_k - t_{k-1}} \right)$$
}
    We denote it:
    $$ \gamma_1 |_{t_1} \dots |_{t_{n-1}} \gamma_n$$
\end{defi}

We can simplify notations if the partition is uniform (i.e. $t_k = k/n$):
    $$ \gamma_1 | \dots | \gamma_n$$

\begin{example}[Oriented Polyline]
    An oriented polyline is the concatenation of consecutive oriented line segments. We denote them:
    $$[a_0 \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow a_n]$$
    where $(a_0, \dots, a_n)\in\mathbb{C}^n$ are "the endpoints".
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Paths \& Regularity}

Until now, the paths we've described were "only" continuous. Integrating over paths is like using changes of variable. Recall that is real analysis, changes of variable generally need to be $\mathcal{C}^1$. Here we define analogous tools in $\mathbb{C}$.

\begin{defi}
    A path is rectifiable if it is piece-wise continuously differentiable, i.e. it is differentiable and its differential is continuous.
\end{defi}

\begin{note}[Continuous differential]
    Let's clarify the meaning of continuous in this case. For this, recall that $f$'s differential at a point $z$ is a linear operator $df_z$. This operator is continuous with respect to its argument, i.e. $h \mapsto df_z(h)$ is continuous.

    A function $f$ is continously differentiable if the map $z \mapsto df_z$ is continuous.

    In the case of paths, this comes down to the path being differentiable and its derivative being continuous.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
    There are no conditions on the differentials at the boudaries "between pieces".
\end{note}

\begin{example}
    An oriented polyline is rectifiable.
\end{example}

\begin{thm*}[Continuously differentiable decomposition]
    A path $\gamma$ is rectifiable if and only if there are $\gamma_1, \dots, \gamma_n$ consecutive continuously differentiable paths and a partition $(t_1, \dots, t_{n-1})$ of $[0,1]$ such that:
    $$\gamma = \gamma_1 |_{t_1} \dots |_{t_{n-1}} \gamma_n$$
\end{thm*}

\subsubsection{Connected sets}

\begin{defi}
    An open subset $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{C}$ is (path-)connected if for any points $x,y \in \Omega^2$, there is a path on $\Omega$ that joins $x$ and $y$. 
\end{defi}

\begin{example}
    
    Some connected open sets:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\mathbb{C}$
        \item $\mathcal{B}_0(r)$
        \item \dots
    \end{itemize}
    Some open, disconnected sets:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\mathbb{C} -\mathbb{R}i$
        \item $\mathcal{B}_0(r) - \lbrace 0 \rbrace$
        \item \dots
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{thm*}
    An open subset $\Omega$ of the complex plane is connected if and only if every pair of points can be joined by a rectifiable path of $\Omega$.
\end{thm*}

\begin{proof}[Sketch of the proof]
    $\gamma([0,1])$ is compact and $\mathbb{C} - \Omega$ is closed. Thus the difference between the two is strictly positive. By uniform continuity of $\gamma$ we can build an oriented polyline that approximates it while staying within $\Omega$ (same technique as is $\mathbb{R}$). The polyline is a rectifiable path on $\Omega$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Line Integrals}
In this section, we define the line integral of $f:\mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ over a rectifiable path $\gamma$ as the integral over $[0,1]$ of $f\circ\gamma \times \gamma'$.

\begin{defi}
    The line integral along a rectifiable path $\gamma$ of $f:\mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, continuous over $\gamma([0,1])$ is:

    $$ \int_\gamma f(z)dz = \int_0^1 f(\gamma(t))\gamma'(t)dt$$
\end{defi}

\begin{note}
    We deliberately overlook the fact that $\gamma$ is only rectifiable and thus $\gamma'$ is undefined at a finite number of points (almost everywhere). 
\end{note}

This gives us a way of explicitly calculating line integrals! We won't be doing (too) much of that here. However, let's look at a few examples.

\begin{defi}[Length of a rectifiable path]
    The length of a rectifiable path $\gamma$ is 
    $$ \ell(\gamma) = \int_0^1 |\gamma'(t)|dt$$
\end{defi}

\begin{note}
    Because of the derivative, the "position" of $\gamma$ in the complex plane has no impact on the length of the path... this is what we'd expect!
\end{note}

\begin{exo}[$\star$]
    Calculate the length of a line segment. 
\end{exo}
\begin{exo}[$\star$]
    Show that $\ell(\gamma) = \ell(\gamma^{\leftarrow})$.
    If $\gamma = \gamma_1 |_{t_1} \dots |_{t_{n-1}} \gamma_n$ a concatenaiton of consecutive, rectifiable paths, show that:
    $$ \ell(\gamma) = \sum_k{\ell(\gamma_k)}$$
\end{exo}
\begin{exo}[$\star$]
    If $\gamma = \gamma_1 |_{t_1} \dots |_{t_{n-1}} \gamma_n$ a concatenaiton of consecutive, rectifiable paths, show that:
    $$ \ell(\gamma) = \sum_k{\ell(\gamma_k)}$$
\end{exo}
\begin{exo}[$\star$]
    Calculate the length of an oriented circle of radius $r$ and with $n$ traversals.
\end{exo}
\begin{exo}
    Give a parametrization for the line integral of $f$ over $[a \rightarrow b]$.
\end{exo}
\begin{exo}
    Give a parametrization for the line integral of $f$ over the oriented circle of radius $r$, of center $0$ and in the positive direction. And with $n$ traversals?
\end{exo}


\subsubsection{Line integral calculus}
\begin{description}
    \item[Complex-linearity] $$\int_\gamma \alpha f + \beta g dz = \alpha \int_\gamma fdz + \beta \int_\gamma gdz$$
    \item[Integration along a reverse path] $$\int_\gamma fdz = - \int_{\gamma^{\leftarrow}}fdz$$
    \item[Integration over a concatenation] If $\gamma = \gamma_1 |_{t_1} \dots |_{t_{n-1}} \gamma_n$ a concatenaiton of consecutive, rectifiable paths, $\gamma$ is rectifiable and:
        $$\int_\gamma fdz = \sum_k \int_{\gamma_k}fdz$$
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Reparametrization \& Changes in variables in line integrals}
Here, we present two useful properties of line integrals: first, that we can reparametrize the path along which we are integrating (i.e. scale time) without changing the value of the integral; second, that we can apply classical change in variable formulas under certain conditions.

\begin{thm*}[Invariance by reparametrization]
Let $f: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is a continuous function, and $\gamma$ a continuously differentiable path.

Let $\phi: [0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]$ an increasing-$\mathcal{C}^1$-diffeomorphism, i.e such that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\phi$ is continuously differentiable
    \item $\phi$ is increasing (i.e. $\phi'(t) > 0$)
    \item $\phi(0) = 0$ and $\phi(1)=1$.
\end{itemize}

Then, if $\mu = \gamma \circ \phi$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\mu$ is a continuously differentiable path with the same endpoints and image as $\gamma$.
    \item $\ell(\mu) = \ell(\gamma)$
    \item The line integrals of $f$ over $\mu$ and $\gamma$ are equal:
        $$ \int_\mu fdz = \int_\gamma fdz $$
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm*}

\begin{note}
    The intutition behind this is that a path is a trajectory on the complex plane, for example, that of a robot. If two robots follow the same path at different speeds but leave and arrive simulataneously, their distances traveled are the same, and they've covered the same ground.
\end{note}

Now let's show that the usual change of variable formula holds in complex analysis:

\begin{thm*}[Changes of variables in line integrals]
    Let $\Omega$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{C}$.

    Let $f: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be a holomorphic function.

    Let $g: f(\gamma([0,1])) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ a continuous function.

    Then,
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $f\circ gamma$ is a rectifiable path.
        \item The following change of variables holds:
            $$\int_{f \circ \gamma}g(z)dz = \int_\gamma g\circ f(z)f'(z)dz$$
    \end{enumerate}

\end{thm*}

\subsubsection{ML-Inequality \& Convergence}

An important consequence of the triangular inequality is that the (line) integral can be bounded by the product of the maximum of the integrand and the length of the path (or segment) one integrates over.

In complex analysis, we have the following important result:

\begin{thm*}[M-L Inequality]
    Let $\gamma$ be a rectifiable path.

    Let $f: A\subset\mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ a continuous function.

    Then, 
    \boxed{$$\left\| \int_\gamma f \right\| \leq \max_{z\in \gamma([0,1])}{\| f(z)\|} \times \ell(\gamma)$$}
\end{thm*}

\begin{proof}
    Use the triangular inequality.
\end{proof}

Thanks to this inequality, we can prove that the line integrals of an uniform approximation $f_n$ of $f$ converge towards the the line integral of $f$, as in $\mathbb{R}$.

\begin{thm*}
    For any rectifiable path $\gamma$ and uniform approximation $f_n$ of $f$ a continuous function (i.e. $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\left\| f_n -f \right \|_{\infty} = 0$), 
    $$ \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_\gamma f_n(z)dz = \int_\gamma f(z)dz $$
\end{thm*}

\subsection{Primitives}

Now that we have defined line integrals, we can identify the main difficulty of defining a primitive of a complex function: the integral depends on the the path use to integrate over! However, derivation is a very local property that does not know what happens far from the derivation point. For these reasons, the fundamental theorem of analysis over $\mathbb{R}$ is ambiguous. Here we adapt it, which yields important results about holomorphic functions.

\begin{defi}
    A primitive of a continuous function $f$ defined on a open subset $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{C}$ is a holomorphic function defined on $\Omega$ such that $g'=f$.
\end{defi}

This formulation is only useful as a definition (or in very simple concrete cases). The following characterisation of primitives is important:

\begin{thm*}[Fundamental theorem of calculus for complex analysis]
    Let $f: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be a continuous function, $\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}$ open, connected.

    A function $g: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is a primitive of $f$ if and only if: for any $z\in\Omega$ and any rectifiable path $\gamma$ on $\Omega$ that joins $a$ and $z$, 
    $$ g(z) = g(a) + \int_\gamma f(w)dw $$
\end{thm*}

\begin{note}
    Notice that the integral characterisation must be true for all paths. The $\mathbb{R}$ equivalent is weaker because there is unique path along which to integrate (modulo reparametrization).

\begin{thm*}[Existence of primitives]
    Let $f: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be a function, $\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}$ open, connected.

    $f$ has a primitive if and only if, it is continuous and for any closed rectifiable path $\gamma$: 
    $$ \int_\gamma f(z)dz = 0 $$
\end{thm*}

\begin{note}
    This is a very useful property: to show that a function does not have a primitive, just show a counter example.
\end{note}

\begin{thm*}[Set of primitives]
    Let $f: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be a function, $\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}$ open.

    If $g$ is a primitive of $f$, then $h$ is also a primitive of $f$ if and only if $h - g$ is constant.
\end{thm*}

\begin{thm*}[Integration by parts]
    Let $\gamma$ rectifiable on $\Omega$, open connected.
    
    
     $\forall f, g: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, holomorphic on $\Omega$ open, connected,

     $$ \int_\gamma f'g = [fg]_\gamma - \int_\gamma fg'$$

\section{Third Session: Connected sets}
In this section, we characterize subsets of the complex plane (we refer to them simply as sets) that are "in one piece".

We present two alternative concepts: path-connectedness and connectedness. The latter is more abstract but more powerful. When the sets we consider are open, the two properties are equivalent.

    \item \dots
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \dots
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Path-connected, connected}

\subsubsection{Path-connected}
We've already seen and used the definition of path connected but as a reminder:
\begin{defi}[Path-connected set]
   $A$ is path connected if any two points of $A$ can be joined by a path on $A$:

   $$\forall a,b\in A, \exists \gamma\in\mathcal{C}^0, \forall t\in[0,1], \gamma(t)\in A~\mathrm{ and}~\gamma(0) = a, \gamma(1) = b$$
\end{defi}

\subsubsection{Connected}
In order to define connectedness, let's introduce the concept of \emph{dilation}.

\begin{defi}[Dilation]
    A set $B$ is a dilation of $A$ if it the union of a collection of non-empty open disks whose centers are at the points of A:

    $$ B = \bigcup_{a\in A}{D(a, r_a)} $$
    where $\forall a\in A, r_a > 0$.
\end{defi}

We can now define connectedness:

\begin{defi}
    A set is connected if all of its dilations are path connected. A set that does not verify this property is disconnected.
\end{defi}

\begin{thm*}[Path-connected $\implies$ connected]
    Every path-connected set is connected.
\end{thm*}

\begin{thm*}[Open, connected $\implies$ path-connected]
    Every open, connected set is path-connected.
\end{thm*}

Let's quickly prove this theorem with a drawing:

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch $(\implies)$]
    Take $z, w \in B$ a dilation of $A$. There is $a, b \in A$ such that $z\in D_a$ and $w\in D_b$.
    As in the drawing, there is a path from $z$ to $a$ in $D_a$, and path from $b$ to $w$. Because $A$ is path-connected, there is a path from $a$ to $b$ in $A$. 
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch $(\impliedby)$, not as pedagogical]
    Show that it is legitimate to write $A$ as a dilation of itself.
\end{proof}

Finally, we can deduce the following theorem:

\begin{thm*}[Open connected $\iff$ open, path-connected]
   An open set is connected if and only if it is path-connected. 
\end{thm*}

\subsubsection{Properties of path-connected/connected sets}

\begin{thm*}
    The following properties are shared by both connected and path-connected sets:
    \begin{description}
        \item[$\cap \mathcal{A} \neq \emptyset \implies \cup \mathcal{A}$ connected: ] if $\mathcal{A}$ is a collection of (path-)conected sets whose intersection $\cap \mathcal{A}$ is non-empty, then the union $\cup \mathcal{A}$ is (path-)connected.
        \item[$A \cap B = \emptyset$, with $A,B$ open $ \implies A\cup B$ disconnected] If $A$ and $B$ are two open, non-empty and disjoint sets, then their union is not (path-)connected.
    \end{description}
\end{thm*}

The following property only holds for connectedness:
\begin{thm*}[Closure of connected sets]
    The closure of a connected set is connected.
\end{thm*}

\begin{note}
    This is \emph{not} true for all path-connected sets. Refer to the textbook for a counter-example.
\end{note}

\subsection{Components}
\begin{defi}
    $B\subset A$ is a (path-)-connected component of $A$ if:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $B$ is (path-)connected
        \item $B$ is maximal with respect to inclusion (i.e. if $B\subsetneq C\subset A$, then $C=A$)
    \end{itemize}
\end{defi}

\begin{thm*}
    The (path-)connected components of a non-empty set $A$ are a partition of $A$, i.e.:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item they are non-empty
        \item pairwise disjoint 
        \item union is $A$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{thm*}

\begin{thm*}
    A non-empty set is (path-)connected if and only if it has a single (path-)connected component.
\end{thm*}

Because connectedness and path-connectedness are equivalent when a set is open, we can show that:

\begin{thm*}
    The partitions of a non-empty open set into path-connected components and connected components are identical. All such components are open.
\end{thm*}

\begin{note}
    This result signifies that we can use "the" decomposition into (path-)connected components.
\end{note}

\subsection{Locally constant functions}
The following concept will be useful in the future.

\begin{defi}
    A function $f: A \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is locally constant if for any $a\in A$ there is a non-empty open disk $D$ centered on $a$ such that $f$ is constant on $A\cap D$.

    In other words, if:
    $$ \forall a \in A, \exists \varepsilon >0, \forall b \in A, |b-a|< \varepsilon \implies f(b) = f(a) $$
\end{defi}

\begin{thm*}
    A set $A$ is connected if and only if every locally constant function defined on $A$ is constant.
\end{thm*}
